# What is Clustering? 

The session asks me to consider what clustering is. 

Clustering is the act of grouping data which is in some way similar for the purpose of classification and trend spotting. 

The given Answer: 

Clustering is a technique for finding similarity-based groups of data, called clusters. It groups data instances that are similar to (near) each other in one cluster and data instances that are very different (far away) from each other into different clusters. 

## What is Clustering For? 

Clustering is a classical unsupervised learning techinique. It is used for grouping large amounts of data without relying on human-defined labels of that data. It is a powerful tool in data mining as it can give meaningful insight into clusters that exist within the dataset. This is particularly useful in situations such as when modelling a consumers behavior, or for recommendation systems. This is because will group individuals who have similar interests and behaviours and work out what the next most effective piece of content or store item to push them is. 

## Clustering Examples

Clustering is one of the most popular data mining techniques used across industries and applications. 

At it#s core, clustering automaticvally groups similar data based on their feature values without requiring human supervision, hence opening the door for big data analytics in numerous applications. 

## Clothers Sizes 

Human Bodies come in varying sizes, and clustering can be used to group customers into a few categories bbased on their body heights/ weights, hence enabling production of "small", "medium" and "large" clothes. 

## Consumption Preferences 

Customers tend to consume different products acording tho their preferences. 
For example, in a cafe, some people enjoy tea with cakes, while others may frequently purchase coffee only. 

Therefore, it is important to cluster them into representative groups for more focused marketing services. 

## Reccomendation Systems 

Reccomendation Systems often use a clustering algorithm. You can view systems in use on sites such as news sites and netflix. This operates by finding market segments and similar preferences amongst users. Then reccomendeding content that other users of a particular segment liked.
