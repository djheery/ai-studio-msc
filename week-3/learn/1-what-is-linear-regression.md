# What is Linear Regression? 

Regression is the process of modelling the numberical relationship between two sets of variables by fitting some functional form (e.g a best fit line) between them. 

Examples of regression: 

- Linear 
- Non-linear 
- Stock market over time 
- Price of a car 
- Chess rating/ improvement 

## Types of Linear Regression 

Regression can be divided into two types of models: 

1. the simple models that only use one independent variable or feature to make a predictions
2. The multiple models that use more than one variable to predict and outcome. 

Each regression model, either simple or multiple, can be described by a functional equation between the input vaiables and output.

If the equation is linear with respect to the variables, it is known as a linear regression model. 
Else it is a Non-linear regression model. 

### Simple Linear Regression (One independent variable)

In a simple model, it is said there is a positive correlation between variable and output if the regression equation is represented as a **straight upward line**. 

If the line is downward it is said that their is a **negative correlation** 

### Simple Non-Linear Regression (One independent Variable)

A simple non-linear regression model is includes a best fit line that aims to capture the overall trend of the data. 
Non-linear regression often visualizes data in a way that linear regression cannot due to the fact that the line in non-linear regression can be curved to fit the shape of the given data.  

### Multiple Regression (More than One independent variable)

Multiple regression uses multiple variables to predict some given output based on the input. 
For example, predicting someones income based on various characteristics such as occupation, sex, age, etc.
