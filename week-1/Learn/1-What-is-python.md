# What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, high level language. It is a general purpose programming language. 
Python's design aims to emphasise code legibility. 

Python's language constructs and object-oriented approach aid programmers in writing clear, logical code for both small and large-scale applications. 

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including: 

- Structured (Procedural)
- Object Oriented 
- Functional Programming. 

Python is popular due to the wide range of libraries at the disposable to a python developer by default.
