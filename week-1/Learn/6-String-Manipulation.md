# String Manipulation

Strings can be manipulated as follows: 

````
animals = "Cats " + "Dogs "
animals += "Rabbits "
print(animals)
# Output: "Cats Dogs Rabbits"

```

String can Be joined as such: 

```
fruits = ",".join(['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'])
print(fruits)
# Output: Apple, Banana, Orange
```


String can have mixed types

```
date = '%s %d %d' % ('Sept', 11, 2021)
print(date)
# Output: September 11 2021

name = "%(first)s %(last)s" {
  "first": "Daniel"
  "last": "Heery"
}

print(name)
# Output: Daniel Heery

```
