# Dictionaires 

Dictionaries are used to store key=>value pairs. 

A dictionary is characterised as a collection that is ordrdered, mutable and does not allow duplicate values. 

The distinction between sets and dictionaries is that they are written as key=> value pairs. 

```

my_dict = {
  "drinks": "Coke",
  "type": "Fizzy",
  "is_available: True
}

print(my_dict)

#Output: my_dict = { "drinks": "Coke", "type": "Fizzy", "is_available: True }

```

Dictionary items are ordered and can be refrenced by using their name in squarebrackets:

```

print(my_dict["drinks"])
# Output: Coke

```
