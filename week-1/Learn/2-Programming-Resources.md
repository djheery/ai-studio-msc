# Programming Resouces 

There are a variety of resources when using python, these include: 

- Anaconda 
- Google Colaboratory (Colab)

## Anaconda

Anaconda is used to install Python, Tensorflow, Keras and other libraries. 
In general, Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing.
This means that it is used for data science, machine learning applications, large-scaled data processing and predictive analytics.
The package aims to simplify package management and deployment. 

## Google Colaboratory

Google Colaboratory is a platform for computationaly intensive programmes. 
The creation of a colab account is a necessity for this module. The lab task will get you to install anaconda and activate colab to start exploring a python programme.
