# Summary 

CNN is a feed-forward network that can extract topological properties from an image. Like almost every other neural network, they are trained with a version of the backpropagation algorithm. 

CNN is designed to recognise visual patterns directly from pixel images with minimal pre-processing. A typical layer consists of Convolution + Activation Function + Subsampling. The final few layers include MLP and SVM.
