# About CNNs 

This slide asks to consider what is the purpose of a CNN and what they Are. 

## My Thoughts

The purpose of a CNN is the take some image and input and find the abstract features that define what the image is of/ what exists within the image. 

CNNs are a DL architecture consisting of layers such as the ones in a Multi-Layer perceptron. However, they apply filters to different parts of the image to learn the abstract features of the image input so that an MLP does not have to learn the perbutations that occur in images and have less inputs to be concered with, lessening the computational intensity. 

## Given Answer:

The concept of CNNs was motivated by the findings of orientation-selective, locally sensitive nerve cells of the visual cortex.
CNNs are specially designed to extract visual features from images so that they can be used for computer recognition and detection. 

CNNs are a special type of Multi Layer Neural Network. As with many other networks, they are feed-forward and can be trained using a backpropagation algorithm. 

CNNs recognize visual patterns with extreme variations in location, scale and orientation (for example, characters written by different people).
