## Introduction 

The learning objectives of this week are the following: 

- Identify an artificial neuron and explain how you actually 'use' it 
- Outline the general architecture of multilevel perceptron (MLP)
  - Detriming MLP and establish common activiation functions 
- Propose changes and improvements for a process of developing neural-network based systems. 
- Explain the difference between SVM and nonlinear SVM 
- Manage Classification performance evaluation and compose a receiver operating characteristic. 
- Reccommend an underfit and overfit model.
