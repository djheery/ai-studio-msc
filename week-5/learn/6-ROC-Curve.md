# Reciever Operating Characterisitic (ROC) curve 

The ROC Curve is create by plotting the TPR against the FPR at various threshold setting. 

In this slide of week 5 there is a diagram where the curve has a sharp increase on the TPR which tapers off slowly with the increase of the FPR.

Different classifiers have different ROCs. For comparison of the ROC, the area under the curve (AUC) is used. 

The AUC is essentially the area covered by the ROC. 

## Good Discriminator 

A good discriminator is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination is varied. 
In the diagram the curve increases very fast on the TPR and slowly tapers off. 

## Poor Discriminator (For Example, Random Guess)

As you can see the TPR varies linearly with the FPR and this shos a characteristic of a random guess classifier

## Area under curve *AUC

The area covered by the curve is greater than that of a straight line. The AUC gives an indicator opf the classification. 
The greater the AUC the better the classifier.
