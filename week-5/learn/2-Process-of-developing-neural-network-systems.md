# Process of Developing Neural Network Based Systems

Below are the steps involved: 

- Collect, organize and format the data
- Separate Data into trainig, validation and testing sets 
- Decide on a network architecture and structure 
- Select a learning alogorithm 
- Set network parameters and initialise their values 
- Initialise weights and start training (and validation)
- stop training, freeze the network weights 
- Test the trained network 
- Repeat and adjust each stage until the output meets the requirements 
- Deploy the network for use on unknown new cases.
