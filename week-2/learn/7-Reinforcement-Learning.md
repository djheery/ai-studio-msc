# Reinforcement Learning 

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is concerend with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximise the notion of cumulative reward. 

In RL data exists as a sequence of states along with some rewards.

For example look at the following states of pacman: 

left, right, straight, left, left, left, straight ðŸ¡ª GOOD

left, straight, straight, left, right, straight, straight ðŸ¡ª BAD

left, right, straight, left, left, left, straight ðŸ¡ª 18.5

left, straight, straight, left, right, straight, straight ðŸ¡ª -3

Given a sequence of states and a reward after completing that sequence, the agent learns to predict the action to take in for an individual state.
