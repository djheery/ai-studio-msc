# What is Machine Learning? 

My own thoughts of what machine learning is: 

The process of training a machine to accomplish a specific task by itself through repetition. This could be done via supervised or unsupervised learning techniques depending on the problem domain. 

Definitions given: 

- A branch of AI concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data
- The process by which a system improves performance from experience, and machine learning specifically as being concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience 
- Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers th eability to learn without being explicitly programmed 
- A set of techniques that can learn from observational data and can make predictions based on it
- Programming computers to optimise a performance criterion using example data or past experience
- Learning means getting better at some task, given some performance measures. 

## The concept of Learning in an ML System 

Within an ML system, learning can be explaind by the following formula: 

Learning = Improving with Experience at Some Task 

- Improve over task T 
- With respect to performance measure P 
- Based on experience E 

Example using spam emails: 

- T: 
  - Identify Spam Emails 
- P: 
  - Percentage of spam e-mails that were filtered and percentage of non-spam emails that were incorrectly filtered out 
- E: 
  - Rendered through a dataset of e-mails that were labelled by users. 

## When is Machine Learning Used? 

My own thoughts 

When predictions involve too many variables for a human to consider 
When a high level of calculation is required to predict something 

Given reasons: 

- Human expertise or Knowledge does not exist 
  - Controlling/ Navigating an autonomous vehicle or unknown terrain such as Mars
- Concept drift where the solution will change over time 
  - Tracking the stock market 
  - Pandemic Prediction 
  - Weather Prediction
  - Online user's behaivior 
- Re-Adaption of the solution to particular usecases
