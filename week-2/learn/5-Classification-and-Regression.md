# Classification and Regression 

In this section you will learn about the concepts of classification and regression. 

## Classification Example: 

You have a scatter plot where the horizontal axis represents the income while the vertical axis represents the outcome. 

In this case, your classification problem is to diferentiate between low-risk and high-risk customers from their income and savings. 
Low-risk customers are characterised by high income and high savings and high-risk customers are the opposite. 

Your problem is to determing the thresholds that can classify customers into low-risk and high risk. 

## Regression Example: 

Regression aims to visualize some type of slope/ best fit line to show the trend of certain related information. 
For example you could train a model to predict the price of a car based on the milage of the car. 

x = mileage 
y = price (continuous valued)

other examples could be 

- Finance - stock market prediction 
- Plane navigation 
- Temporal trends - weather over time
