# Examples of Machine Learning: 

Below are some examples of machine learning and their TPE 

## Machine Translation 

Translating text in images. 

This involves: 

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
- Machine Translation functionalites in a Single Application 

T: Translate the Text in Images 
P: Accuracy of the recognized images 
E: Rendered through a dataset of images that were translated by users

## IRIS recognition 

Recognizing and individuals pupils for identity purpouses: 

T: Recognize the Iris and whom it belongs to 
P: Accuracy of recognition 
E: Rendered through a dataset of irises that were labelled by users 


## Fingerpring recognition 

Recognizing and individuals fingerprint for identity purpouses: 

T: Recognize the fingerprint and whom it belongs to 
P: Accuracy of recognition 
E: Rendered through a dataset of fingerprints that were labelled by users 

## Voice recognition 

Recognizing and individuals voice for identity purpouses: 

T: Recognize the voice and whom it belongs to 
P: Accuracy of recognition 
E: Rendered through a dataset of voices that were labelled by users 

## Facial recognition 

Recognizing and individuals face for identity purpouses: 

T: Recognize the face and whom it belongs to 
P: Accuracy of recognition 
E: Rendered through a dataset of faces that were labelled by users 

## Dynamic Signature recognition 

Recognizing an individuals signature and the permutations considering the permutations that could occur in a signature for identity purpouses: 

T: Recognize the signature and whom it belongs to 
P: Accuracy of recognition 
E: Rendered through a dataset of signatures that were labelled by users
