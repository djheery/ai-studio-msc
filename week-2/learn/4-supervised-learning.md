# Supervised Learning 

In supervised learning, the training data comes with labeled answers which the learning algorithm can compare to. This is so that it can assess its accuracy and improve the model. 

An input could be training text, documents, images, sounds etc. 
These are then converted to feature vectors which act as input to a machine learning algorithm. 

There are lables that are associated with these inputs. The learning algorithm will utilize these labels to learn the relationship between the inputs and the labels, aiding improvement of accuracy. 

The model created is then used to predict the answer for new, unknown values. 
At this stage, labels are not necessary. You can just present the input data which is converted to feature vectors, and subbsequently fed into the predictive model. 

The predictive model will be able to predict the expected label. 

## Classification probelms 

In classification problems, the number of categories is finite and the labels are categorical. 
This could be a task such as identifying fruits or cars etc.

## Regression Problems 

In regression, the label is a continuous value.
For example, the regression algorithm could try to predict the price of an item in a given class. 

## Ranking Problems 

In ranking probles, the label will be a ranked value. 
This could indicate a fruits preference or likely top sellers.
