# Unsupervised Learning 

Unsupervised Learning is used when the outcome is not properly known. 

For example grouping objects into two different sets, but without the information for what the "right" set is for any object ahead of time. 

The model is not given any answers to learn from; it must make sense of the data just given the observations themselves. 

The type of input to Unsupervised Learning models can be the same as supervised learning models. 
The main difference is how the algorithm learns. It is not from any prior associated label. 
Instead it infers/ makes predictions based on the data, letting the data "speak for itself" and associates the data in a manner by which it feels different data is associated. 

## Unsupervised vs Supervised Learning 

- Unsupervised Learning is given data, that is, examples, but no labels. 
- Maybe you do not know what you are looking for yet - so you are exploring the data for any hidden patterns or grouping structures. 
- Unsupervised learning is often used for exploratory data analysis. 

## Unsupervised Learning Applications 

Learn clusters/ groups without any labels: 

- Clustering users on a dating site on their information and behaviour
- Cluster movies based on their properties 

Customer Segmentation 

- Grouping users based on their characteristics 
  - age
  - location 
  - what they have bought
  - The same as market segmentation for effective marketing 

Text Mining: 

- Analyse the text of product descriptions to find the terms that carry the most meaning for a certain category
