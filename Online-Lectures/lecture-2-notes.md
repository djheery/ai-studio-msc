# Lecture 2 Notes 

Changes to the Assignments: 

- Group work removed
  - You submit your own work individually
  - Everything is individual 

## Assignment Details 

Assignment is in two parts 

### Part 1: 

Literary Review. 
You pick a topic such as medical imaging and choose two algorithms such as Decision Tree, and CNN write about:

- What they are 
- How they are being used 
- What are the strengths and limitations

Review academic journals and experiments to broaden your knowledge.
Assess them in one application domain. 

Can you understand how AI is applied to those concepts 
In AI the ability to identify the differences between Machine Learning Algorithms and their strengths in different usecases is vital. 

### Part 2: 

More hands on.
Pick one of those topics and analyze the results from that dataset. 
Assess the accuracy of the model. 

Around 2000 words for part 1 and 2000 for part 2.

If you want to score high you need to do extra. 
Going beyond the labs. 

For example, a lab for CNN architectures, you should modify the programme, maybe add more layers, change the epochs, manipulate it to go beyond the pass marks. Analyse why you have higher accuracy. 

Document your Tests and explain what you have done to improve the accuracy of your model. 

We a free to any of the libraies for the coding section. 

#### Plagaurism 

They put your work into a software which assess the similarity between your work and other academic works. 
You can test your similarity score, by uploading it to turntin but do not submit it, as the universty saves your document and when you update it. Anything beyond 25% similarity would be checked. It doesn't mean that you are plagaurising as titles and references all can be similar in other.
